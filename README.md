# addon-for-post-meta-translation-using-deepl

Translate post meta data when using DeepL translate.

## Why Addon for Post Meta Translation using DeepL?

By default, the __DeepL__ plugin only translates the post `title`, `content` and `excerpt`.

This plugin enables you to translate post meta data using __DeepL__. It integrates nicely with the __DeepL__ & __DeepL pro__ plugin and is useful for translating post meta for popular plugins like __WooCommerce__, __Yoast SEO__ and so on.
